# Eloquent Form Builder
### A drag and drop gui form builder by [Elle (booellean) Pope](https://github.com/booellean), made to coincide with [Eloquent Forms](https://github.com/nickwest/EloquentForms) by [Nick West](https://github.com/nickwest)

This package is designed with edits in mind. If you want to alter code to use your own css libraries or interact with your backend API, then please fork and edit away!

Out of the box, this package works with the Laravel framework, hence some of the naming convention.

Please do not change class names or the type property passed to those classes. These are structured to be instantiated dynamically, and changing them can be a real mess for your code later!
